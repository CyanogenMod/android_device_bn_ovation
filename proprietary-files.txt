# This file lists all of the proprietary blobs that need to be
# extracted from a stock device. The extract-files.sh script
# parses this file and copies the blobs into the vendor and build
# trees as needed.
#
# File format:
#   - Comments lines start with a hash (#) character and will be
#     ignore.
#   - Blobs should be listed with their path relative to /system
#     on the device.
#   - A different destination path may be specified after a colon on
#     the same line as the blob source path. Otherwise, the
#     destination path with be the same as it was on the device.
#   - Options for a particular blob are specified in a comment
#     after the blob path.
#
# Blob options:
#   - needed_for_build: the blob will also be copied into the obj
#     directory for use in the build of other open source files.
#   - optional: if the blob is not found, extraction will not abort.
#     directory for use in the build of other open source files.
